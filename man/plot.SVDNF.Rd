\title{
DNF Filtering Distribution Plot Function}
\description{
This function plots the median of the filtering and prediction distributions estimated from the \code{DNF} along with user-selected upper and lower percentiles.
}
\usage{
\method{plot}{SVDNF}(x, lower_p = 0.05, upper_p = 0.95, tlim = 'default',
  location = 'topright', ...)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{An \code{SVDNF} object. The \code{plot} plots the median and selected percentiles from the filtering distribution.}
  \item{lower_p}{Lower percentile of the filtering distribution to plot.}
  \item{upper_p}{Upper percentile of the filtering distribution to plot.}
  \item{tlim}{The \code{plot} function plots the filtering and prediction distributions over the interval \code{tlim}. For example to plot the first \code{500} steps, set \code{tlim = c(1, 500)}. By default, filtering and prediction distribution estimates for every step in the time-series are generated.
  
If \code{tlim} is set to a single number (e.g., \code{tlim = c(5)}), \code{plot} graphs the estimated probability density functions of the filtering (in magenta) and prediction (in blue) distributions at that timestep.}
  \item{location}{Location keyword passed to the \code{legend} function to determine the location of the legend. The keyword should be selected from the list \code{"bottomright"}, \code{"bottom"}, \code{"bottomleft"}, \code{"left"}, \code{"topleft"}, \code{"top"}, \code{"topright"}, \code{"right"}, and \code{"center"}.}

  \item{...}{Other parameters to be passed through to function.}
}
\value{
No return value; this function generates two plots.

The first has the median of the volatility factor obtained from the prediction distribution as well as its upper and lower percentiles from \code{lower_p} and \code{upper_p}.

The second has the median of the volatility factor obtained from the filtering distribution as well as its upper and lower percentiles from \code{lower_p} and \code{upper_p}.
